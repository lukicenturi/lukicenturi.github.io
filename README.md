# Hi, Welcome to this repository

## Here, is the collections of games I made during the early days I learn HTML5 and Javascript.
## Most of the games here is build using only Canvas, CSS, and JS (A little JQuery)
## I feel that working in these games really improved my understanding on Javascript.

### If you want to play the games I build, you can go here [https://lukicenturi.github.io/](https://lukicenturi.github.io/)
